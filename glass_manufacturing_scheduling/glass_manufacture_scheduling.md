You are planning the production at a glass manufacturer. This manufacturer only produces wine and beer glasses:

- there is a maximum production capacity of 60 hours
- each batch of wine and beer glasses takes 6 and 5 hours respectively
- the warehouse has a maximum capacity of 150 rack spaces
- each batch of the wine and beer glasses takes 10 and 20 spaces respectively
- the production equipment can only make full batches, no partial batches

Also, we only have orders for 6 batches of wine glasses. Therefore, we do not want to produce more than this. 
Each batch of the wine glasses earns a profit of $5 and the beer $4.5.
